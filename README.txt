This is the seventh homework assignment for the UCF Coding Bootcamp.

In this assignment, we were asked to create a firebase database for storing train information.

Getting Started
Adding Train Data

Instructions:
The user has to input the train name, destination, first train time in HH:mm format, frequency of the train.
The user inputs have to be stored in a firebase database.
Using this information we have to calculate the next arrival time and the minutes away.
We used Moment.js to format the time and calulate the next arrival and minutes away.
